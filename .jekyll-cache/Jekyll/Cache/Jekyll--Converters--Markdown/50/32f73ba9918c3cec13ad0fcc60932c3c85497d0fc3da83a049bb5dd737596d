I"<p>Sometime in the summer of 2019, I stumbled upon a game known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Cold_Beer" target="_blank">Ice Cold Beer</a> in an arcade bar in San Francisco. It was a simple game, but very, very frustrating. After shelling out all my coins there and having to retreat home for the night, I got the bright idea to recreate the game at home so that I could practice and be a pro by the time I returned (spoiler: I havenâ€™t gone back since)</p>
