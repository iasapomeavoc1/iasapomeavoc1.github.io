I"Y<p>In my sophomore year of college, I started a team with some friends to participate in the NASA RASC-AL ROBO-OPS competition. We build a tele-operated rover to drive around simulated lunar and martian terrains to pick up and store colored rocks. I designed and built the chassis and drivetrain, which was modeled after a rocker-bogie system common to many existing space rovers. We placed 2nd in the 2014 competition.</p>
