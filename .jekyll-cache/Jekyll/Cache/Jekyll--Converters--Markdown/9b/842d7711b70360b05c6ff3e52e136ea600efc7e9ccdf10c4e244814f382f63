I"<p>During my senior year at MIT, I worked in the <a href="http://darbelofflab.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Dâ€™Arbeloff Laboratory</a>
under Professor Harry Asada and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fred-parietti/" target="_blank">PhD Federico Parietti</a>. I designed and built prototypes for a wearable robotic limb, with a 2DOF ball joint and a 1DOF pneumatic linear joint. I wrote my <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/105691?show=full" target="_blank">undergraduate thesis</a> on the control of the pneumatic joint.</p>
