I""<p>I’ve seen a great deal of progress in quadruped robotics over the years, from BigDog to SpotMini, and now widespread development at universities like the MIT Mini Cheetah or Stanford Doggo. I’ve always wanted to try my hand at developing a similiar but smaller, low cost robot for home enviornments. More specifically, I wanted to try and recreate the experience of a pet, with robotics.</p>
