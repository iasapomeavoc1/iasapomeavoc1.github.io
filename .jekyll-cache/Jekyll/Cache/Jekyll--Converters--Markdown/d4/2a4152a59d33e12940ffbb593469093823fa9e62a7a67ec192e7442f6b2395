I"Õ<p>Iâ€™ve seen a great deal of progress in quadruped robotics over the years, from BigDog to SpotMini, and now widespread development at universities like the MIT Mini Cheetah or Stanford Doggo. Iâ€™ve always wanted to try my hand at developing a similiar but smaller, low cost robot for home enviornments. More specifically, Iâ€™ve wanted to try and recreate the experience of a pet, with robotics. This is an application that I havenâ€™t seen much development on</p>
