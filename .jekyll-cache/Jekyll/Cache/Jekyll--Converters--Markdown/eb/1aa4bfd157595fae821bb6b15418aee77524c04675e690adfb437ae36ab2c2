I"÷<p>Iâ€™ve seen a great deal of progress in quadruped robotics over the years, from BigDog to SpotMini, and now widespread development at universities like the MIT Mini Cheetah or Stanford Doggo. Iâ€™ve always wanted to try my hand at developing a similiar but smaller, low cost robot for home enviornments. More specifically, I wanted to try and recreate the experience of a pet, with robotics.</p>

<p>I designed all custom parts in Solidworks, which incudes the leg mechanisms, brackets, and body platform. The legs are 3D printed in black PLA, and the body is a ABS plate that was cut and drilled by hand.</p>
