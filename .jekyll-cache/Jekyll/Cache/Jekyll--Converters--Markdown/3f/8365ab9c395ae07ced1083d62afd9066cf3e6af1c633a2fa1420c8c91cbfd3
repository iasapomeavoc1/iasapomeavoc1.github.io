I"‰<p>In my sophomore year of college, I started a team with some friends to participate in the NASA RASC-AL ROBO-OPS competition. We build a tele-operated rover to drive around simulated lunar and martian terrains to pick up and store colored rocks. I designed and built the chassis and drivetrain, which was modeled after a rocker-bogie system common to many existing space rovers. Our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1M_xUPZQM" target="_blank">midpoint progress video</a> portrays an early prototype of the drivetrain in action. <a href="http://robo-ops.nianet.org/archives/2014-winning-teams/" target="_blank">We placed 2nd</a> in the 2014 competition, and later showcased our robot in <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2015/first-stop-robot-road-race-next-stop-nasa-0508" target="_blank">here</a> and in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfXZ7k29mW4" target="_blank">in our team promo video</a>.</p>
