I"a<p>Sometime in the summer of 2019, I stumbled upon a game known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Cold_Beer" target="_blank">Ice Cold Beer</a> in an arcade bar in San Francisco. It was a simple game, but very, very frustrating. After shelling out all my coins there and having to retreat home for the night, I got the bright idea to recreate the game at home so that I could practice and be a pro by the time I returned (spoiler: I haven’t gone back since)</p>

With some research, I figured out the actual arcade game’s mechanism, which was two lead screws driven by motors and a bar mechanism on a pivoting linkage. That seemed too complex for what I wanted to build, so I opted for using fishing line and pulleys, with hobby grade servos. Window shade pulleys did the trick, and rubber grommets snugly fit on the servo horn while providing a track and enough friction to pull the fishing line.</p>

<p>Once I showed that worked out pretty well, I looked into making the ball return mechanism - a few tracks of wood that would guide the ball back to central return area, and a small linear motor to push the ball back into play. Detecting the ball had returned was hard. Initially I tried a circuit that would complete when the steel ball fell onto two metal tracks, but was unable to maintain continuity for a reliable enough period to detect the ball accurately. Then, I tried using tiny push button switches, but the ball wasn’t heavy enough and there wasn’t enough room to create a lever arm. I settled on using an LED and photoresistor, which worked easily and could be applied to the target sensing as well.
