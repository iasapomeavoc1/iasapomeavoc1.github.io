I"7<p>I’ve seen a great deal of progress in quadruped robotics over the years, from BigDog to SpotMini, and now widespread development at universities like the MIT Mini Cheetah or Stanford Doggo. I’ve always wanted to try my hand at developing a similiar but smaller, low cost robot for home enviornments. More specifically, I’ve wanted to try and recreate the experience of a pet, with robotics. This is an application that I haven’t seen much development on - most universities or companies working on legged robots promote plans for commercial or military use. Instead of focusing on a high integrity, high cost system that might at times be safety critical, I’m envisioning what is essentially a toy. 
These kinds of “toy robot pets” have existed for decades now, but with advances in hardware and robotic behavioral algorithms, I believe there’s a potential for a significant upgrade in what kinds of things we can do with these robots. Think about playing a game of fetch, a REAL game where you wag an object like a ball or stick in front of the robot’s</p>
