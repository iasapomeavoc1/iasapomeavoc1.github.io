I've worked at Cruise since the summer of 2016 as a mechanical engineer. A self-driving car company based in San Francisco, we are focused on developing core autonomous vehicle systems to be able to deploy a fleet of ride-share vehicle at massive scale. Cruise is partially owned subsidiary of General Motors, and I work closely with their team on vehicle integration. 

I've worked on designing the articulating sensors detailed in this <a href="https://medium.com/cruise/cruise-embedded-systems-articulating-radars-7cae24642930" target="_blank">Medium post</a>
